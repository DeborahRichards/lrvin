        <h4>1. DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE</h4>
        <P>
         Deep Tissue massage is a therapeutic technique that targets the inner layers of muscle and 
         its surrounding connective tissue known as fascia. Using firm pressure and slow, deep strokes,
         your massage therapist works to break up scar tissue and release muscle adhesions, or knots. 
         These knots are bands of rigid muscles that negatively impact your circulation and cause pain 
         and inflammation. Deep tissue can relieve the built-up tension from stress, exercise, and prolonged 
          postural problems.
